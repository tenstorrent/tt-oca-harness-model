/*
 * SEP_SMU_002  sep_interop  --  shared protocol contract (single source of truth).
 *
 * Included by BOTH firmwares (SMC producer main.c + SEP consumer sep_smc_interop.c) and
 * parsed by the cocotb checker so the DUT stimulus and the DV expectations can never drift
 * (AGENTS.md one-source rule). Keep every value a plain integer/hex #define so the Python
 * parser can read it -- no expressions the parser cannot evaluate.
 *
 * Topology -- the SMC CPU and the real SEP CPU exchange 32-bit words over the two ports of
 * the SEP AXI-lite mailbox pair (och_sep_top_reg.h AXIL_MAILBOX_*):
 *   port 0  OUTBOUND_MAILBOX_0 @ 0x10A00000  <- SEP-local port  (the SEP drives this side)
 *   port 1  INBOUND_MAILBOX_0  @ 0x10A00800  <- SMC-facing port (the SMC drives this side)
 * The mailbox cross-connects the two FIFOs: a WRITE_DATA push at one port is drained by the
 * other port's READ_DATA, and each port's STATUS.empty / read-data IRQ tracks the FIFO it
 * drains. So the SMC pushes TOKEN/ACK at 0x10A00800 (SEP pops at 0x10A00008), and the SEP
 * pushes RESPONSE/SEP_PASS at 0x10A00000 (SMC pops at 0x10A00808).
 *
 * SEP<->SMC scratch -- the SEP reaches SMC CPU_CTRL scratch through the SEP->SMC alias
 * (SEP-view 0x4000_0000 -> SMC-local 0xC000_0000): SMC scratch12 (SMC-local 0xC00390E0) is
 * the SEP READY rendezvous at SEP-view 0x400390E0.
